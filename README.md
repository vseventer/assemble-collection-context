# assemble-collection-context [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/assemble-collection-context.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/assemble-collection-context)
> Assemble.io plugin for sharing collection context between build targets.

## Getting Started
In the command line, run:

```bash
npm install assemble-collection-context --save
```

To register the plugin with Assemble, adjust your projectâ€™s Gruntfile.

```js
module.exports = function(grunt) {
  // Configuration.
  grunt.initConfig({
    assemble: {
      options: {
        plugins : [ 'assemble-collection-context', 'other/plugins/*.js' ]
        context : { dest: '.tmp/' }
      },
      blog: {
        'dist/': [ 'templates/*.hbs' ]
      },
      pages: {
        options : { data: '.tmp/*.json' },
        'dist/' : [ 'index.html' ]
      }
    }
  });
};
```

In your `index.html`, you can now access the categories, pages, and tags (plus any custom collections you might have) from the `blog` target:

```html
{{#each blog.pages}}
  {{ data.title }}
{{/each}}
```

Note the collection context is generated only for targets you run. This means that only running `assemble:pages` will not work, the `.tmp/blog.json` file will only be available if you ran `assemble:blog` prior.

## Options

### dest
Destination of collection context. Required.
